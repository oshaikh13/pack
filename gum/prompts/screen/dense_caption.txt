Provide a detailed description of the user's actions across the provided video. 

Include as much relevant detail as possible, but don't be verbose.

To help, here are some keystrokes that lie within the video:
---
{keystrokes}
---

Since the actions may not be consecutive, use timestamps to denote the relevant intervals of the video.

Use the following JSON format:
[
    {
        "timestamp": "MM:SS-MM:SS, MM:SS-MM:SS,...",
        "caption": "[concise 2-3 sentence description of the actions the user is taking across these frames]"
    },
    ...
]

Carefully analyze the entire provided video, isolate specific actions, and generate your result in the above format.

The full video is {max_time} long, so make sure the intervals cover the ENTIRE video.
